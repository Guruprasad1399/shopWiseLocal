## Current State and Future Potential

### Hackathon Implementation
This app was initially developed as a part of the notJust.dev Hackathon and represents a focused effort over a 3-day coding sprint. During this period, key features were prioritized to demonstrate the core functionality and potential of the app.

### Future Enhancements
While the current version showcases the fundamental aspects of the app, it holds significant potential for expansion and refinement. Post-hackathon, the plan is to:

- **Expand Features:** Introduce additional functionalities that enhance user engagement and provide more value to local businesses.
- **Improve User Experience:** Continuously refine the UI/UX to ensure a seamless and enjoyable user journey.
